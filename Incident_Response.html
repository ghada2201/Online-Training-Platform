    <h1>Module 4.5: Incident Response - Handling Phishing Breaches</h1>

    <!-- Objective Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this module is to equip employees with the knowledge and steps required to respond effectively to a phishing breach. By following a structured incident response plan, employees can minimise damage, contain the breach, and help the organisation recover swiftly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Immediate Actions -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 1: Immediate Actions</h2>
        <p>
            When you recognise a phishing attempt or realise that you have interacted with a phishing email, it’s crucial to act quickly to prevent further damage. Follow these immediate steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.1 Recognise the Phishing Attack:</strong> Identify the phishing attempt by verifying suspicious emails, links, or attachments. Look for red flags such as unusual sender addresses, requests for sensitive information, and unexpected attachments.</li>
            <li><strong>1.2 Do Not Engage:</strong> If you realise that you have received a phishing email, do not reply, click on any links, or download any attachments. Engaging with the content could trigger malware or further compromise your information.</li>
            <li><strong>1.3 Disconnect from the Network:</strong> If you suspect that you've clicked on a phishing link or opened a malicious attachment, immediately disconnect your device from the network (Wi-Fi or wired) to prevent potential malware from spreading.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> You receive an email claiming to be from your IT department, asking you to verify your account by clicking a link. Upon closer inspection, you notice that the sender's email address is slightly off, and the message contains an urgent tone. You realise it's a phishing attempt and immediately report it without clicking the link.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Report the Incident -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 2: Report the Incident</h2>
        <p>
            Reporting a phishing incident promptly is crucial to ensuring that your IT and security teams can take action to mitigate the threat. Here’s how you should report a phishing incident:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2.1 Notify the IT/Security Team:</strong> Report the incident to your IT or security team as soon as possible. Provide them with details about the phishing email, including the subject line, sender information, and any actions you may have taken.</li>
            <li><strong>2.2 Use the Reporting Tool:</strong> If your organisation has a designated "Report Phishing" button in the email client or a specific email address for reporting phishing attempts, use it to report the suspicious email. This helps the security team analyse the threat and take appropriate actions.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3 Escalate if Necessary:</strong> If the phishing attempt is particularly sophisticated or if sensitive information was compromised, escalate the issue to higher management or the relevant authorities within your organisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> After clicking on a phishing link, you immediately notify your IT department using the "Report Phishing" button in your email client. You also call the IT Helpdesk to provide additional details about the incident.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Contain the Breach -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 3: Contain the Breach</h2>
        <p>
            Once the incident has been reported, it’s essential to contain the breach to prevent further damage. Here are the steps to contain the breach:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3.1 Isolate the Affected System:</strong> If a device has been compromised, isolate it from the network to prevent the spread of malware or unauthorised access to other systems. This may involve disconnecting the device from the internet, disabling its Wi-Fi, or unplugging it from the network.</li>
            <li><strong>3.2 Identify the Scope of the Breach:</strong> Work with the IT/security team to determine the extent of the breach. Identify any data that may have been accessed or compromised and assess the potential impact on the organisation.</li>
            <li><strong>3.3 Change Compromised Credentials:</strong> If you have entered credentials or other sensitive information into a phishing site, immediately change your passwords. Use complex, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> After realising that your credentials have been compromised, you disconnect your device from the network and change your passwords. The IT team isolates the affected system to investigate the breach and prevent further damage.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Recover from the Incident -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 4: Recover from the Incident</h2>
        <p>
            Recovery is a critical phase where the organisation works to restore affected systems and secure any compromised data. Follow these steps to recover from a phishing incident:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1 Restore Affected Systems:</strong> If malware was installed, work with the IT/security team to remove it and restore the affected systems from clean backups. Ensure that all security patches and updates are applied to prevent further exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>4.2 Communicate with Affected Parties:</strong> If sensitive data was compromised, notify affected individuals or organisations according to your company's data breach response policy. Transparency is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that all parties can take necessary precautions.</li>
            <li><strong>4.3 Document the Incident:</strong> Document the incident in detail, including how the phishing attempt was identified, the steps taken to contain and mitigate the breach, and any lessons learned. This documentation is vital for legal, compliance, and future reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> After restoring systems from a clean backup, the IT team works with the affected department to communicate the breach to impacted clients. Detailed documentation is prepared to record the incident and the response actions taken.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Learn and Improve -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 5: Learn and Improve</h2>
        <p>
            Learning from the incident is essential to preventing similar breaches in the future. Here’s how to ensure continuous improvement:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5.1 Conduct a Post-Incident Review:</strong> After the incident has been resolved, conduct a thorough review with the involved teams to analyse what happened, why it happened, and how it could have been prevented. Identify gaps in the current security measures and response procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>5.2 Update Security Measures:</strong> Based on the findings from the post-incident review, update and improve security protocols, phishing awareness training, and incident response plans to prevent similar incidents in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>5.3 Provide Additional Training:</strong> Offer follow-up training to the affected employee(s) and the wider team if necessary. Reinforce key phishing recognition strategies and any new protocols introduced as a result of the incident. This helps ensure that employees are better prepared to handle future threats.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> After reviewing the incident, the security team identifies a need for additional training on recognising sophisticated phishing attempts. A targeted training session is scheduled for the affected team, focusing on improving their phishing detection skills and awareness.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Communicate Lessons Learned -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Step 6: Communicate Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            Sharing the insights gained from the incident and the response process is crucial for improving the organisation's overall security culture. Here’s how to effectively communicate lessons learned:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>6.1 Share Key Insights:</strong> Share insights from the incident and the response process with the broader organisation. This helps to raise awareness and improve overall security practices. By learning from each other's experiences, employees can be better prepared to recognise and respond to phishing threats.</li>
            <li><strong>6.2 Integrate Feedback:</strong> Collect feedback from the teams involved in the incident response to identify areas for improvement in communication, tools, or procedures. Use this feedback to refine future training and incident response plans.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> After a phishing breach, the IT department shares a detailed report with all employees, highlighting the tactics used by the attackers and the steps taken to mitigate the breach. Employees are encouraged to provide feedback on the response process, which is then used to improve the organisation's incident response plan.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="section sub-section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
