    <div class="slide">
        <h1>Introduction to Social Engineering</h1>
        <h2>Module 1.1: What is Social Engineering?</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 2: Definition of Social Engineering -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>What is Social Engineering?</h2>
        <p>
            Social Engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions 
            or divulging confidential information. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets technical 
            vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human vulnerabilities. These attacks rely on 
            the trust, curiosity, fear, and even the helpfulness of individuals to gain unauthorised access 
            to systems or sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social engineering can take many forms, including deceptive emails, phone calls, or even 
            face-to-face interactions. It is often the first step in a more extensive cyber attack, aiming to 
            gather information that can be used to penetrate more secure systems.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
            <p>
                An attacker calls an employee, pretending to be from the IT department, and claims there 
                is an urgent issue with their account. The attacker asks the employee to provide their 
                login credentials to resolve the issue. Trusting the caller, the employee complies, giving 
                the attacker access to the companyâ€™s systems.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3: Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> A broad attempt to steal sensitive information via email, messages, or fake websites.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                <p>An email appears to be from your bank, asking you to click a link and confirm your account details. The link leads to a fake website that captures your login information.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A more targeted attack, where the attacker tailors the message to a specific individual or organisation, often using personal details to make it more convincing.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                <p>The CEO of a company receives an email that appears to be from the CFO, asking for an urgent transfer of funds. The email is well-crafted and includes references to specific projects or recent conversations.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> An attacker creates a fabricated scenario (a pretext) to engage the victim and extract information.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                <p>An attacker calls a help desk, pretending to be a high-level executive who has forgotten their password. The help desk, believing the story, resets the password and gives it to the attacker.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> An attack that involves offering something enticing (like free software or a USB drive) to trick the victim into compromising their security.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                <p>A USB drive labeled "Confidential Salary Information" is left in a common area. Curious employees pick it up and plug it into their computer, unknowingly installing malware.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Tailgating:</strong> An attacker physically follows an authorised person into a restricted area without proper credentials.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                <p>An unauthorised individual waits near the entrance of a secure facility and follows an employee through the door when they swipe their access card, gaining entry without detection.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Why Social Engineering is a Threat -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Why is Social Engineering a Threat?</h2>
        <p>
            Social engineering is a significant threat because it bypasses many traditional security measures 
            by targeting human behaviour. While firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption can protect against 
            many cyber threats, social engineering attacks exploit the natural trust and curiosity of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consequences of a successful social engineering attack can be severe, including data breaches, 
            financial loss, and repetitional damage. For example, if an attacker gains access to login credentials 
            through a phishing attack, they may be able to access sensitive company data, transfer funds, or 
            even deploy malware across the network.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="example-title">Real-World Impact:</p>
            <p>
                In 2016, a major US-based company fell victim to a spear-phishing attack. An employee received 
                an email that appeared to be from the CEO, requesting a large wire transfer. Believing the email 
                to be legitimate, the employee authorised the transfer, resulting in the company losing millions of dollars.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Awareness and training are essential components of any defence strategy against social engineering. 
            By educating employees on the tactics used by attackers and encouraging a culture of skepticism and 
            verification, organisations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these types of attacks.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 5: Conclusion -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding what social engineering is and the different forms it can take is crucial for maintaining 
            security within an organisation. Through awareness and proper training, we can better defend against 
            these types of attacks and protect our sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, attackers are always looking for the weakest link in the security chain. By staying vigilant 
            and following best practices, you can ensure that you are not that link.
