    <!-- Slide 2: Best Practices for Email Security -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Best Practices for Email Security</h2>
        <p>Email is one of the most common vectors for social engineering attacks. Here are some essential practices to protect yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify the Sender:</strong> Always check the sender’s email address carefully. Phishing emails often come from addresses that look legitimate at first glance but contain slight misspellings or extra characters.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> An email from "support@amaz0n.com" instead of "support@amazon.com" is likely fraudulent. Hover over the sender's address to see the full email address.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Hover Over Links:</strong> Before clicking on any links in an email, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. Be cautious if the URL looks suspicious or doesn’t match the expected domain.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the URL displayed is different from what you expect, do not click on it. Instead, type the legitimate website address directly into your browser.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Be Wary of Attachments:</strong> Avoid opening email attachments from unknown or unexpected sources, especially if they are executable files (.exe) or compressed files (.zip, .rar). These files could contain malware.</li>
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Even if the email appears to come from someone you know, verify with the sender if the attachment is unexpected or unusual.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Look for Urgent Language:</strong> Be cautious of emails that pressure you to act quickly, such as “Your account will be suspended” or “Immediate action required.” These are common tactics used by attackers to create a sense of urgency.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Take a moment to think before you act. Urgent requests should always be verified through a different communication channel, such as a phone call to the organisation’s official number.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3: Physical Security Measures -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Physical Security Measures</h2>
        <p>Protecting your organisation from social engineering also involves being vigilant about physical security. Here’s what you can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don’t Hold the Door:</strong> Avoid letting someone you don’t know follow you into a secure area, even if they look like an employee or have a convincing story. Tailgating is a common tactic used to gain unauthorised access.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If someone claims they forgot their ID badge, direct them to the security desk instead of letting them enter behind you.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Workspace:</strong> Keep sensitive documents and portable devices, such as laptops, secure when not in use. Lock your computer screen whenever you step away from your desk.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a privacy screen on your monitor if you work with sensitive information in a public or open space.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Beware of Baiting:</strong> Avoid using USB drives or other media found in public areas, as they might be planted by an attacker to infect your system with malware.</li>
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you find a USB drive, report it to your IT department instead of plugging it into your computer.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Follow Access Control Procedures:</strong> Always use your own ID badge to access secure areas. Never borrow or lend access cards, and report lost or stolen badges immediately.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Importance of Reporting -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Importance of Reporting</h2>
        <p>Reporting suspicious activities and incidents is crucial for maintaining security. Here’s why it matters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Reporting suspicious emails, phone calls, or behaviours can help your security team detect potential threats before they cause harm. Even if you’re not sure, it’s better to report and let the experts investigate.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Most organisations have a dedicated email address or hotline for reporting security incidents. Make sure you know how to reach your security team quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Protect Your Colleagues:</strong> By reporting a phishing attempt or social engineering tactic, you help protect others in your organisation from falling victim to the same attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Contribute to Security Improvements:</strong> Reports of attempted attacks provide valuable data that your security team can use to improve defences and training programs.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> After several employees report a similar phishing email, the security team updates the email filtering system to block future attempts and launches a targeted awareness campaign.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Maintain a Security-First Culture:</strong> Regular reporting and open communication about security threats help foster a culture where everyone is vigilant and proactive about security.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 5: Staying Vigilant and Proactive -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Staying Vigilant and Proactive</h2>
        <p>Social engineering attacks can be sophisticated, but staying vigilant and proactive can significantly reduce your risk:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continually Educate Yourself:</strong> Social engineering tactics are constantly evolving. Stay informed about the latest threats and participate in ongoing training to keep your knowledge up-to-date.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sign up for security newsletters or follow trusted cybersecurity sources to stay informed about new social engineering techniques and how to defend against them.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Question Unusual Requests:</strong> Don’t be afraid to question any request that seems out of the ordinary, even if it appears to come from a higher authority. Social engineers often rely on intimidation or a sense of urgency to push through their attacks.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your "CEO" emails you asking for a wire transfer, call them directly on a known phone number to confirm the request before taking any action.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Ensure that your passwords are complex, unique to each account, and stored securely. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Ensure that your passwords are complex, unique to each account, and stored securely. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
            <div class="tip">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Signs of a Breach:</strong> Be alert to signs that your accounts or systems may have been compromised. Unexpected password resets, unusual account activity, or strange emails could indicate a breach.</li>
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you suspect that your account has been compromised, change your passwords immediately and notify your IT/security team.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 6: Conclusion -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Protecting yourself and your organisation from social engineering attacks requires a combination of awareness, vigilance, and proactive behaviour. By following the quick tips provided in this module, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these deceptive tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, social engineers rely on exploiting trust and human nature. By staying informed, questioning unusual requests, and reporting suspicious activities, you play a vital role in maintaining the security of your organisation.
