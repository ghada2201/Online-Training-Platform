    <!-- Slide 1: Title Slide -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h1>Advanced Phishing Simulations</h1>
        <h2>Practice and Learn</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 2: Introduction -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this section is to conduct live simulations where participants practice recognising and responding to advanced phishing attempts. These simulations are designed to mimic realistic phishing scenarios tailored to the organisation’s context, providing immediate feedback and tips for improvement.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3: Realistic Phishing Scenarios -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Realistic Phishing Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, participants will be exposed to a series of realistic phishing scenarios. These scenarios are specifically tailored to reflect the organisation’s unique context, including typical communications, common requests, and potential threats.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario 1: Fake Executive Email</strong> – An email appearing to be from a high-ranking executive requesting immediate action on a financial transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Scenario 2: Vendor Invoice Scam</strong> – An email from a familiar vendor requesting payment to a new bank account, accompanied by an attached invoice.</li>
            <li><strong>Scenario 3: IT Support Phishing</strong> – An email from IT support asking the user to click a link to update their system credentials due to a supposed security breach.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="interactive">
            <h3>Live Simulation: Test Your Skills</h3>
            <p>Participants will receive these phishing emails in real-time during the simulation. The goal is to identify and respond appropriately to these threats.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examine the sender's email address for authenticity.</li>
                <li>Look for common red flags such as urgency, suspicious links, and unexpected attachments.</li>
                <li>Consider whether the request is consistent with previous communications from the supposed sender.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            "Phishing simulations are a safe way to test your ability to recognise and respond to real threats. Every suspicious email is an opportunity to sharpen your skills."
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Immediate Feedback -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Immediate Feedback and Improvement Tips</h2>
        <p>
            After each scenario, participants will receive immediate feedback on their performance. This feedback is crucial for reinforcing learning and helping participants improve their ability to identify phishing attempts in the future.
        </p>
        <div class="discussion">
            <h3>Feedback on Performance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed analysis of your response to the phishing email.</li>
                <li>Identification of what you did well and where you could improve.</li>
                <li>Specific tips on how to spot similar phishing attempts in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            "Learning from your mistakes in a controlled environment is one of the best ways to prepare for real-world scenarios. Use this feedback to become more vigilant and discerning."
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 5: Continuous Vigilance -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>The Importance of Continuous Vigilance</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing threats are constantly evolving, with attackers refining their tactics to be more convincing and harder to detect. Continuous vigilance is essential to staying ahead of these threats and protecting your organisation from potential breaches.
        </p>
        <div class="discussion">
            <h3>Why Vigilance Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Even with training and simulations, the most important defence against phishing is a vigilant and cautious mindset. By maintaining a healthy skepticism of unexpected requests, even from trusted sources, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always verify the authenticity of requests, especially those involving sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Report any suspicious emails to your IT/security team immediately.</li>
                <li>Stay informed about the latest phishing techniques and tactics used by cybercriminals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            "The best defence against phishing is a well-trained, vigilant workforce that treats every email with a level of caution. When in doubt, check it out."
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 6: Conclusion -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The advanced phishing simulations provided in this module have offered you the opportunity to practice and refine your ability to detect and respond to sophisticated phishing attempts. The scenarios were designed to challenge you with realistic threats that you may encounter in your day-to-day activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            By participating in these simulations and receiving immediate feedback, you have gained valuable insights into your current level of awareness and areas where you can improve. Remember, the key to defending against phishing attacks is not just knowledge, but also continuous vigilance and a commitment to staying informed about the latest tactics used by cybercriminals.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you move forward, apply what you've learned in these simulations to your daily work. Be skeptical of unexpected requests, double-check the legitimacy of emails, and don't hesitate to report anything suspicious to your IT or security team. Your proactive approach to cybersecurity is crucial in protecting not just yourself, but the entire organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your participation, and remember—staying one step ahead of attackers starts with you.
